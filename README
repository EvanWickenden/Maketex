Maketex



#### OVERVIEW #####

This program is used as a wrapper around a vim session working on tex files;

Upon each write within vim, pdflatex will be run in the background and the resulting .pdf file will be opened;

In fact, the shell script maketex.sh will be run upon each vim save, meaning behaviour can be easily customized. 

vim is the default editor used with this program, but editors can also be specified on the command line. 


#### INSTALLATION #####

To make and copy executable to /usr/local/bin/ 

$   make install 

To install with debuging enabled

$   make debug
$   make install

The installation directory can be set manually within 'Makefile'.




#### USAGE #####

$   maketex <filename> [text-editor]

<filename> can either end in ".tex" or not; if it does not, ".tex" will be appended.  

The output of pdflatex will be redirected into pdflatex-out-<filename>, so that any errors pdflatex encounters can be easily determined. 

This file will also be opened in the same vim session. It is reachable, within vim, by |:bn|.

This file will be automatically cleaned up upon maketex session termination.

If text-editor is not specified, then vim will be used. 


#### DEPENDENCIES #####

This program was developed on and for *NIX environments. It depends crucially on pdflatex to actually generate the pdf files.
