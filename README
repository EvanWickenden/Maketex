Maketex



#### OVERVIEW #####

This program is used as a wrapper around a vim session working on tex files;

Upon each write within vim, pdflatex will be run in the background and the resulting .pdf file will be opened;

In fact, the shell script maketex.sh will be run upon each vim save, meaning behaviour can be easily customized. 




#### INSTALLATION #####

To make and copy executable to /usr/local/bin/ 

$   make install 

To install with debuging enabled

$   make debug
$   make install

The installation directory can be set manually within 'Makefile'.




#### USAGE #####

$   maketex <filename>

<filename> can either end in ".tex" or not; if it does not, ".tex" will be appended.  

The output of pdflatex will be redirected into pdflatex-out-<filename>, so that any errors pdflatex encounters can be easily determined. 

This file will also be opened in the same vim session. It is reachable, within vim, by |:bn|.

This file will be automatically cleaned up upon maketex session termination.




#### DEPENDENCIES #####

This program was developed on and for *NIX environments. It depends crucially on pdflatex to actually generate the pdf files.
